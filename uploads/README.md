Introduction
======

The goal of the discourse project is to take advantage of advances in mobile learning technologies to develop a discussion tool designed specifically for online courses. The need is great. Every online course is potentially a market for a discussion tool that effectively addresses this need.

Current online discussions are constructed as a chronological record of posts over time. The instructor and related instructional objectives of the course are not represented in this model. In contrast, posts in discourse discussions will have a finer granularity that can be viewed by topic, context, author, or aggregated student annotations. The design specification for discourse is based on an academic year of research by Mable Kinzie and Bill Ferster, working in collaboration with graduate students participating in the instructional design sequence.

This decoupling of contributions from the temporal order in which they are generated allows discussion from different instructional perspectives. Contributors may have a context in mind, such as a response to an instructor's prompt, contribution of a new idea to the discussion, or responding to another user's comment.

discourse discussions will allow the instructor to encourage engagement with specific instructional materials and objectives. Rules of engagement define the way that instructors and students are notified within the discourse system. Collections of rules templates provide default rule sets for pedagogical situations such as a case study deconstruction, a brainstorming session, or a reading discussion. An instructor can quickly choose an appropriate template or modify it to meet special needs. Feedback is modeled after Facebook-style â€œlikingâ€ in a way that encourages thoughtful extensions of dialog that advance instructional objectives.
